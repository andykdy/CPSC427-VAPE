Creative portion:
- momentum
Advanced controls:
    - Salmon rotates to face mouse
    - leftmouse applies acceleration in the direction of the mouse
Before the template changed and before I read the other assignments, added:
- right ctrl fires bullets (in the direction being faced) which kill turtles

Ideas for creative part:
Better background
UI to show points and debug details. Lives?
Add states, and create a menu, leaderboard, and difficulty (if randomizing turtles)
